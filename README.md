This is our Vehicle Emergency Alert System, designed to prevent and assist with accidents and emergencies involving large trucks in the transportation industry.

This system utilizes a Raspberry Pi, Sense HAT, bluetooth OBD, and USB GPS to collect vehicle data and upload it to an AWS cloud server. 

'vehicle_alert.py' acts as the main driver for this program.
